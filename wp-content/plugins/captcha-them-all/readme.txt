== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Language is still in English on Google Recaptcha =
This is commonly because the Language you are trying to use is not supported by Google Recaptcha service.  Please see the list of supported Google Recatpcha languages [here](https://developers.google.com/recaptcha/docs/language)



If your language is supported, make sure the language is set to the one you want in WordPress Admin Panel ***Settings -> General, 'Site Language'** setting.  If this is set to your language and it is still not displaying the correct language for Google Recaptcha, please make a [Support Ticket](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/captcha-them-all)



= I see the word 'ReCaptcha' but I dont see a Google Recaptcha box? =
This is generally because the **'Site Key'** or **'Secret Key'** for Google Recaptcha in **Settings -> Captcha Them All** is missing or invalid.  Fix this setting and the box should display.



= I get the error 'Error when parsing configuration: Unknow client:' for the image when displayed for Captchas.Net =
This happens because the **Captchas.Net username** in **Settings -> Captcha Them All** is missing or invalid.



= I always see 'Captcha Validation Failed' when using Captchas.Net =
This is most likely because your **Captchas.Net secret key** in **Settings -> Captcha Them All** is missing or invalid.



= It said this plugin supports WooCommerce?  But I can't see the Captcha box!!  =

* Changed "$errors->add( 'denied', __( '<strong>ERROR</strong>: Captcha validation failed.' ) );" to "$errors = new WP_Error( 'denied', __( '<strong>ERROR</strong>: Captcha validation failed.' ) );" so the errors returned to the user for registrations are overwritten unless captcha is validated (Better Security - Malicious users cannot hit website to discover valid email addresses or usernames) - DOES NOT WORK FOR WOOCOMMERCE.
